## First Experience

I used Copilot every day from the start of the release. It was already mind-blowing that it could autocomplete repetitive functions or tasks directly into the code editor as I typed.

A new AI Code Editor named Cursor came up, tried it on the first day. First experience: not worth it, pricey, messy and Copilot could do it better - at that time.

I came up with an alternative solution to use Avente.nvim to sort of use Cursor capability inside my neovim editor, it's great, but still limiting, and not as powerful as Cursor.

## Second Chance

I got an opportunity to use Cursor again in my recent project as the team gave me the monthly license for free - free stuff! why not?

It got better! so much better than the first time I tried it. It's pretty helpful, so helpful that I feel the Cursor can read my mind, it knows what I want to do next. 

Much more powerful especially after Sonnet 3.7 was released, It's so pleasant to work on.

## Cons of using Cursor AI

The big drawback for me is it is VSCode-based. I was already comfortable using neovim, and then I have to "downgrade" to vscode again?!

Nothing wrong with VSCode but I already spent tens of hours creating my config for neovim, just to escape VSCode Browser Javascript Code Editor.

I think that's okay because I already upgraded my machine, and it went smoothly. Back when I got the crappy machine, VSCode was so laggy and crashed too much that I had to move to Emacs and then Neovim just to feel stable, lol.
