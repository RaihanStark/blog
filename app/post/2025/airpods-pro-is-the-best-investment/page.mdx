As a software engineer, the most important investments are courses, computers/laptops, multiple monitors, and noise-canceling headphones.

I was thinking, *why would I buy a $249 earphone* when I could do the same thing with my $7 earphones? There’s no way I’m willing to buy that overpriced Apple product.

## The Problem

I can’t work productively when there is too much noise around me. Because of this, I always listen to music as loud as possible so I can’t hear any noise with my earphones.

It was great, but after a few years of doing that, my ears started ringing often, and it was painful.

It turns out my ears were damaged, and I’m still 23 years old! I don’t know if I’ll still be able to hear at 50 if I continue this habit.

## The Solution

I searched for noise-canceling headphones—they were supposed to block noise even if I didn’t play music. I didn’t believe it.

I quickly bought the AirPods Pro 2, tried them for the first time, and I was **MINDBLOWN**!

* I can hear better with Transparency Mode since it already has a hearing-aid feature.
* I can work better in Active Noise Cancellation Mode. I don’t have to turn up the music loud—or even play any music—and still, there’s no noise!
* It protects my ears when I go outside and there’s a sudden loud noise; it automatically cancels it.

Now I can’t leave home without them—not because I want to listen to music, but because I can hear **better** and they protect my ears.

## Conclusion

This isn’t a review, just my experience trying noise-canceling stuff—and it was worth every penny.
