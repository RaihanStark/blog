## Money is everything?

I was reading a lot of books about life and how to live a good life, and I was thinking that money is everything because all of people dreaming about having tons of money, I'm not.

I may have privilege to not be born in a poor family since I was born in a pretty enterpreneurial family where we often gain and lose a lot of money which is a good thing.

It's a good thing to have money, but it's not the only thing that defines us.

## Existential crisis

It is funny that I got my mid-life crisis at 24 years old after I began to read a lot of books about philosophy like socrates, plato, aristotle, etc.

I was thinking that I'm not sure what I want to do with my life, I'm not sure what I want to achieve, I'm not sure what I want to be.

I know the direction of what I have to be, but I'm not sure WHY I have to be that way.

## Searching for purpose

I began to hate the system, I began to hate the way of living, I began to hate the way of how people are living, chained to the system, unable to break free from it.

The only thing that I can see that is not chained to the system is the open source projects.

## The purpose of my life

I want to retire as early as possible so I can contribute to open source as much as possible and help people.

If not retire, at least I want to be in a position where I can sustain myself and my family while contributing to open source, that's enough for me.
